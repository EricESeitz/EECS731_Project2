Raw data has been downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays according to the project description

Data:
We load the .csv file into Pandas using the following command:
pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Eric\Documents\EECS 731\Project 2\data\archive\Shakespeare_data.csv")

Now we need to formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis.

Goal: 
Build one or more classification models to determine the player using the other columns as features

We have the following header information for the play file:
Dataline 	Play 	PlayerLinenumber 	ActSceneLine 	Player 	PlayerLine

Ideas:
How might this help our goal of determining the player using the other columns as features?
We could extrapolate the most common words said by a player?
We could also extrapolate which player shows up in which play. 
Maybe also find out how often a player shows up? Weight it more towards frequent players.

Thus, if we know the line of the play, the play itself, and the frequency of which players show up we might be able to extrapolate out the player.
